=head1 NAME

IOMux::Open - simulate the open() function

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IOMux::Open qw( -| |- |-| < > >> tcp);

  # pipe for reading
  my $who = $mux->open('-|', 'who', 'am', 'i');
  print <$who>;

  # two-way connection (like IPC::Open3)
  my $echo = $mux->open('=|', 'cat');

  # file
  my $pw = $mux->open('<', '/etc/passwd');
  my @noshell = grep /\:$/, <$pw>;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a simple wrapper to bring various alternative connection
implementations closer to normal Perl. It also saves you a lot of explicit
require (C<use>) lines of code.

With this module, code is simplified. For instance, the real logic is:

  use IOMux::Pipe::Read;
  my $who = IOMux::Pipe::Read->new
   ( run_shell => [ 'who', 'am', 'i' ]
   );
  $mux->add($who);
  print <$who>;

In the short syntax provided with this module:

  use IOMux::Open '-|';
  my $who = $mux->open('-|', 'who', 'am', 'i');
  print <$who>;

You only need to C<use> one C<::Open> module with some parameter, in
stead of requiring all long names explicitly. As you can see, the
object gets added to the mux as well.
