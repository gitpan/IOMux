=head1 NAME

IOMux::Handler - handle a connection

=head1 INHERITANCE

 IOMux::Handler is extended by
   IOMux::Handler::Read
   IOMux::Handler::Service
   IOMux::Handler::Write

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # only extensions can be instantiated

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item IOMux::Handler-E<gt>B<new>(OPTIONS)

 -Option--Default
  fh      <required>
  name    <stringified handle>

=over 2

=item fh => FILEHANDLE

=item name => STRING

Nice name, most useful in error messages.

=back

=item IOMux::Handler-E<gt>B<open>(MODE, WHAT, OPTIONS)

Most handlers provide an easy way to instantiate them via the
L<IOMux::Open|IOMux::Open> module.

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<fh>

Returns the filehandle.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<fileno>

The sequence number of the filehandle, UNIX style.  See C<man 3 fileno>

=item $obj-E<gt>B<mux>

=item $obj-E<gt>B<name>

=item $obj-E<gt>B<usesSSL>

=back

=head2 User interface

=head3 Connection

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<close>([CALLBACK])

Close the handler. When the CALLBACK is provided, it will be called
after the filehandle has been closed and the object disconnected from
the multiplexer.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<timeout>([TIMEOUT])

Set (or get) the timer. The TIMEOUT value is a certain number of seconds
in the future, after which the C<mux_timeout> callback is called.  When
TIMEOUT is not defined or zero, the timer is cancelled.  Timers are not
reset automatically.

When the timeout value is very large (larger then C<time> when the
program started), it is considered absolute, not relative. This is
very useful when you wish a timeout to appear on some exact moment.

When the timeout is very small (but larger than 0), then still at
least one C<select> loop will be used for this timeout is handled.

example: 

  $conn->timeout(23.6);   # over 23 seconds
  print $conn->timeout;   # moment in epoc
  $conn->timeout(0);      # cancel

  use Time::HiRes 'time';
  BEGIN {$begin = time}
  $conn->timeout($begin+2.5);

=head2 Multiplexer

=head3 Connection

The I<user interface> provides a higher level interaction then the
raw interface. These methods may be extended by users, but there
are usually simpler methods to achieve that.

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<mux_init>(MUX, [HANDLER])

Called after the multiplexer has added this handler to its
administration.

In rare cases, it may happen that an other HANDLER needs to
be called when this filehandle get tickled, especially for
tricks with bundles.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<mux_remove>

Remove the handler from the multiplexer.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<mux_timeout>

Called when a timer expires on the FILEHANDLE.

Use L<timeout()|IOMux::Handler/"Connection"> to set (or clear) a timeout.
When new data is sent or received on the FILEHANDLE, that will B<not>
expire the timeout.

=back

=head3 Reading

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<mux_except_flagged>(FILENO)

Called (in the rare case) that an exception event if flagged. This
means that the socket needs urgent inspection.

According to the Linux manual page for C<select()>, these exceptions
only happen when out-of-band (OOB) data arrives over udp or tcp.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<mux_read_flagged>(FILENO)

Called when the read flag is set for this handler.

When you extend this module, you probably want to override
C<mux_connection()> or C<mux_input()>, not this "raw" method.

=back

=head3 Writing

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<mux_write_flagged>(FILENO)

Called when the write flag is set for this handler; this indicates
that the output buffer is empty hence more data can be sent.

When you extend this module, you probably want to override
C<mux_outputbuffer_empty()>, not this "raw" method.

=back

=head3 Service

=head2 Helpers

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<extractSocket>(HASH)

=item IOMux::Handler-E<gt>B<extractSocket>(HASH)

Extract IO::Socket::INET (or ::SSL) parameters from the HASH and
construct a socket from it. The used options are all starting with
a capital and removed from the HASH. Additionally, some controlling
options are used.

 -Option --Default
  socket   <created>
  use_ssl  <false>

=over 2

=item socket => IO::Socket object

You may pre-initialize an IO::Socket.

=item use_ssl => BOOLEAN

When true, a IO::Socket::SSL object will be created, otherwise a
IO::Socket::INET object.

=back

=item $obj-E<gt>B<fdset>(STATE, READ, WRITE, ERROR)

Change the flags for the READ, WRITE and/or ERROR acceptance by the
mux to STATE.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<show>

Returns a textblock with some info about the filehandle, for
debugging purposes.

example: 

  print $conn->show;

=back
